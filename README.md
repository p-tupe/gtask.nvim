# Gtask.nvim (WIP)

Google Tasks in Neovim

## Motivation

Overtime, I have consolidated all my stuff into neovim - local CSVs over spreadsheet apps, markdown notes instead of the latest flavor of Evernote, journals, progress trackers, dev logs, so on and so forth.

One notable exception however has been task management. While I've tried many apps and strategies for managing my tasks, Google Tasks was one I kept returning to. It has all the features that I need (and few more), and it works well with (unfortunately, indispensable) Google Calendar. I've been _mostly_ happy with it (esp on mobile with tight integration with assistant). So why Gtask.nvim?

Besides the obvious end-goal of managing my entire life from a single interface, there are some pain points that I hope to address with this plugin.

1. Proper Description formatting

   First and foremost, my aim to have tasks slot into my current workflow. By that, I mean I do not plan to use it as a "separate" app or interface, rather it should fit inside notes as I take them.

   For e.g., if I were to start a new note for "travel plan 3025" I would like to add tasks right inside the rest of the plan.

```
# Travel Plan 3025

## Let's go to Mars!

... notes on space regulations

- [] Check visa requirements <--- This should become a task
    Notes on visa requirements when checking
```

One of the major issues I face is that the "description" field is extremely cumbersome to use. Unable to add any formatting, and the way it is shown is downright horrendous. In here though, it's just another markdown file. Neat, eh?

2. Proper Subtask ordering

   I like to have tasks with subtasks. And I like to view my tasks by due date. Ideally, when I order by date I would see my main task as a superset for my subtasks - which are hopefully ordered by date. Google disagrees.

This is how I would like to see it:

```
Day 1:
- [] Mars Trip Shopping List
  - [] Spacesuit stripes from XMart on day 1
- [] Spaceship maintenance on day 1

Day 2:
- [] Inform friends and family
    - [] Call nanny on day 2
- [] Mars Trip Shopping List
  - [] Waterbottles from nearby convenience store on day 2

Day 3:
- [] Put on a lot of sunscreen just in case on day 3
- [] Mars Trip Shopping List
  - [] Noise Cancelling Earplugs from NCE on day 3
```

Instead of how it would show:

```
Day 1:
- [] Spacesuit stripes from XMart on day 1
- [] Spaceship maintenance on day 1

Day 2:
- [] Waterbottles from nearby convenience store on day 2
- [] Call nanny on day 2

Day 3:
- [] Noise Cancelling Earplugs from NCE on day 3
- [] Put on a lot of sunscreen just in case on day 3

No Date:
- [] Mars Trip Shopping List
- [] Inform friends and family
```

This is an extremely niche personal requirement, but hey - that's why Gtask.nvim exists in the fist place!

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Neovim** with Lua support
- **plenary.nvim** - Required for HTTP requests and async operations
- **curl** - System command for API requests
- Internet connection for OAuth authentication

### Installation

Using your favorite plugin manager:

**lazy.nvim:**

```lua
{
  "your-username/gtask.nvim",
  dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
  config = function()
    -- Optional configuration
  end
}
```

**packer.nvim:**

```lua
use {
  "your-username/gtask.nvim",
  requires = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }
}
```

### Authentication

The plugin uses a secure OAuth proxy service for authentication. No manual Google Cloud setup required!

1. Run `:GtaskAuth` in Neovim
2. Visit the generated authorization URL in your browser
3. Complete Google OAuth consent (you'll see an "unverified app" warning - click "Advanced" â†’ "Go to gtask.nvim (unsafe)")
4. Authentication completes automatically - return to Neovim

**Note:** You only need to authenticate once. Tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically.

## Usage

### Available Commands

#### Authentication

- `:GtaskAuth` - Start OAuth authentication flow
- `:GtaskClearAuth` - Clear stored tokens (force re-authentication)
- `:GtaskAuthTest` - Test authentication server (development)

#### Task Management

- `:GtaskGetLists` - Fetch and display all task lists
- `:GtaskGetTasks <list_id>` - Fetch and print tasks for a specific list
- `:GtaskView <list_id>` - Open formatted task view in new buffer

#### Markdown Integration

- `:GtaskSync <list_id>` - Sync markdown tasks from current buffer to Google Tasks

### Task-only Workflow

View and manage Google Tasks directly within Neovim:

1. **Get your task lists:** `:GtaskGetLists`
2. **View tasks:** `:GtaskView <list_id>`
3. **Manage tasks:** Use the formatted view with hierarchical sorting by due date

The task view displays:

- Tasks grouped by due date
- Subtasks under their parent tasks
- Completion status and descriptions
- Clean markdown formatting

### Integrated Workflow

Manage tasks directly in your markdown files:

1. **Create tasks in markdown:**

```markdown
# My Project Notes

- [ ] Main task with due date
      Description for the main task
  - [ ] Subtask one
  - [x] Completed subtask
- [ ] Another task
      Additional notes about this task
```

2. **Sync with Google Tasks:** `:GtaskSync <list_id>`

**Task Format:**

- `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks
- `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Indented lines become task descriptions
- Nested tasks become subtasks

### Features

- **Secure Authentication** - OAuth proxy service handles credentials
- **Automatic Token Refresh** - Seamless re-authentication when needed
- **Hierarchical Task Display** - Subtasks grouped under parents, sorted by due date
- **Markdown Integration** - Convert markdown task lists to Google Tasks
- **Offline Support** - View cached tasks when offline
- **No Manual Setup** - No Google Cloud configuration required

### Security & Privacy

- **No credentials stored locally** - Uses secure OAuth proxy
- **Tokens encrypted** - Stored securely in Neovim's data directory
- **No data logging** - Proxy service doesn't store or log your tasks
- **Standard OAuth flow** - Industry-standard authentication
